Aim - Build a secure Hospital Managment REST API using Flask that supports RBAC.
The system should manage hospital information and user accounts with distinct roles(admin, user).
Admins can create, read, update and delete Hospital records.

Regular user can only see and filter hospital store inforamtion.
The system must use JWT for authentication and SQL Alchemy for ORM.
Filtering and pagination should be also included.
